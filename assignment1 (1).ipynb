What is Python, and why is it popular?\n"," - Python is a formal language for creating instructions for a computer to follow, it is also known as programming language.\n"," - It is popular language for multiple applications like web developing, software development, widely used in data industries, image processing, versatility, automention and so on.\n","\n","2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n"," - it is a program that directly executes the python code that translates python code into machine code  without compiling it first.\n","\n","3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n","  - This are reserved words that have special meanings and cannot be used as veriable names or identifiers. such as- and, as, assert, break, class, elif, else except, continue, from, for, etc.\n","\n","4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n","  - No, it is not possible to use keywords as verianle names.\n","\n","5. What is mutability in Python?\n","  - Objects/ container where states or value can be changed after they are created are called mutable object or container.\n","\n","6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n","  - Lists are mutable because they can be modified or can be change after creation but tuples are immutable because they cannot modified after creation.\n","\n","7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n","  -\n","  '==' checks for value equality, while 'is' checks if two references point are the same object.\n","\n","8. What are logical operators in Python?\n","  -  Operators to combine or negate conditions:\n","  -And: Both conditions must be true.\n","  -Or: At least one condition must be true.\n","  -Not: Returns the opposite of the condition.\n","\n","9. What is type casting in Python?\n","  - Type casting converts one data type to another (e.g., string to integer).\n","number = \"7\"\n","number = int(number)\n","\n","10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n"," - Implicit: Automatic conversion (e.g., int to float).\n","  - Explicit: Manual conversion using functions like int(), str().\n","\n","11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n","  - To execute specific blocks of code based on conditions:\n","\n","if age > 18:\n","    print(\"Adult\")\n","else:\n","    print(\"Minor\")\n","\n","12. How does the elif statement work?\n","  - Adds multiple conditions:\n","\n","age = 20\n","if age < 12:\n","    print(\"Child\")\n","elif age < 18:\n","    print(\"Teenager\")\n","else:\n","    print(\"Adult\")\n","\n","13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n","    - for: Iterates over sequences.\n","    - while: Executes as long as a condition is true.\n","\n","14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop?\n","    - When the number of iterations is unknown:\n","\n","     password = \"\"\n","    while password != \"admin\":\n","    password = input(\"Enter password: \")\n","  "],"metadata":{"id":"jdFnRBmRoKJ7"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"q8qeFormn6MO"},"outputs":[],"source":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#PRACTICAL QUESTIONS\n"],"metadata":{"id":"rnlW-PxhoiqC"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["1.
